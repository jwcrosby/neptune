  <p>In Xanadu did Kubla Khan<br>
  A stately pleasure-dome decree:<br>
  Where Alph, the sacred river, ran<br>
  Through caverns measureless to man<br>
    <p style="text-indent: 15px;">Down to a sunless sea.<p>
  So twice five miles of fertile ground<br>
  With walls and towers were girdled round;<br>
  And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,<br>
  Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;<br>
  And here were forests ancient as the hills,<br>
  Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.<br>
  <br>
  But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted<br>
  Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!<br>
  A savage place! as holy and enchanted<br>
  As e’er beneath a waning moon was haunted<br>
  By woman wailing for her demon-lover!<br>
  And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,<br>
  As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,<br>
  A mighty fountain momently was forced:<br>
  Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst<br>
  Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,<br>
  Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher’s flail:<br>
  And mid these dancing rocks at once and ever<br>
  It flung up momently the sacred river.<br>
  Five miles meandering with a mazy motion<br>
  Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,<br>
  Then reached the caverns measureless to man,<br>
  And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean;<br>
  And ’mid this tumult Kubla heard from far<br>
  Ancestral voices prophesying war!<br>
    <p style="text-indent: 15px;">The shadow of the dome of pleasure<p>
    <p style="text-indent: 15px;">Floated midway on the waves;<p>
    <p style="text-indent: 15px;">Where was heard the mingled measure<p>
    <p style="text-indent: 15px;">From the fountain and the caves.<p>
  It was a miracle of rare device,<br>
  A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!<br>
  <br>
    <p style="text-indent: 15px;">A damsel with a dulcimer<p>
    <p style="text-indent: 15px;">In a vision once I saw:<p>
    <p style="text-indent: 15px;">It was an Abyssinian maid<p>
    <p style="text-indent: 15px;">And on her dulcimer she played,<p>
    <p style="text-indent: 15px;">Singing of Mount Abora.<p>
    <p style="text-indent: 15px;">Could I revive within me<p>
    <p style="text-indent: 15px;">Her symphony and song,<p>
    <p style="text-indent: 15px;">To such a deep delight ’twould win me,<p>
  That with music loud and long,<br>
  I would build that dome in air,<br>
  That sunny dome! those caves of ice!<br>
  And all who heard should see them there,<br>
  And all should cry, Beware! Beware!<br>
  His flashing eyes, his floating hair!<br>
  Weave a circle round him thrice,<br>
  And close your eyes with holy dread<br>
  For he on honey-dew hath fed,<br>
  And drunk the milk of Paradise.</p>
